# Ticketing Service Assignment - Implementation Write-up

## Executive Summary

I have successfully implemented a complete ticketing service in Go that meets all the specified requirements. The system demonstrates strong software engineering principles with clean architecture, comprehensive error handling, and thorough testing. All test scenarios work as specified, and the system properly prevents double-booking while providing comprehensive conductor query functionality.

## Requirements Fulfillment

### ✅ Core Requirements Met

**1. REST Interface Implementation (without HTTP server)**

- Implemented `Response` and `HTTPClient` interfaces as specified
- Created `HTTPResponse` struct and `MockHTTPClient` for testing
- No HTTP server running, as required

**2. Domain Models - All Implemented**

- **Stations**: `Station` struct with name
- **Routes**: `Route` struct with sequence of stops and distances
- **Services**: `Service` struct representing physical trains on routes at specific times
- **Carriages**: `Carriage` struct as train components
- **Seats**: `Seat` struct with comfort zones (first-class, second-class)
- **Bookings**: `Booking` struct with unique identifier and passenger/ticket collections
- **Tickets**: `Ticket` struct with seat, origin, destination, service, and passenger
- **Passengers**: `Passenger` struct with name

**3. Required Routes Implemented**

- ✅ Paris → Calais → Antwerp → Amsterdam (with 2 stops in between)
- ✅ Paris → Calais → Dover → London (with 2 stops in between)
- ✅ Amsterdam → Utrecht → Hannover → Berlin (with 2 stops in between)

**4. All Test Scenarios Working**

- ✅ **Scenario 1**: 2 passengers, 2 first-class seats (A11 & A12) from Paris to Amsterdam on service 5160 on April 1st, 2021
- ✅ **Scenario 2**: Duplicate booking correctly fails with proper error handling
- ✅ **Scenario 3**: Mixed class booking (1 second-class H1, 1 first-class N5) from Paris to Amsterdam on April 2nd, 2021
- ✅ **Scenario 4**: Duplicate mixed class booking correctly fails

**5. Conductor Queries Implemented**

- ✅ **Query 1**: Passengers boarding at London on service 5160 on April 1st, 2021: 0 passengers (correct - no bookings from London)
- ✅ **Query 2**: Passengers boarding at Paris on service 5160 on April 1st, 2021: 2 passengers (John Doe, Jane Smith)
- ✅ **Query 3**: Passengers leaving at Amsterdam on service 5160 on April 1st, 2021: 2 passengers (John Doe, Jane Smith)
- ✅ **Query 4**: Passengers traveling between Calais and Amsterdam on service 5160 on April 1st, 2021: 2 passengers (John Doe, Jane Smith)
- ✅ **Query 5**: Passenger on seat A11 in service 5161 on December 20th, 2021: Conductor Test Passenger

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Clean Architecture

- **Domain Package**: Core business models and logic
- **Reservation Package**: Business logic for booking management
- **Test Data Package**: Sample data setup for testing
- **Main Package**: Application entry point and demo scenarios

### Key Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between domain models, business logic, and data
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each package has a focused purpose
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Business logic depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes

### Data Flow

```
ReservationRequest → Validation → Seat Availability Check → Ticket Creation → Booking Storage
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Features

**1. Seat Management**

- Explicit seat assignment (no automatic algorithm)
- Prevents double-booking with proper error handling
- Supports different comfort zones (first-class, second-class)
- Validates seat existence within carriages

**2. Route Validation**

- Validates origin/destination are on the same route
- Ensures origin comes before destination in route sequence
- Proper distance tracking between stations

**3. Booking System**

- Unique booking IDs (B0001, B0002, etc.)
- Atomic booking operations
- Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes
- Date-based booking validation

**4. Conductor Queries**

- `GetPassengersBoardingAt()`: Find passengers boarding at specific stations
- `GetPassengersAlightingAt()`: Find passengers leaving at specific stations
- `GetPassengersBetweenStations()`: Find passengers traveling between stations
- `GetPassengerOnSeat()`: Find passenger occupying specific seat

### Error Handling

- Custom `ReservationError` with specific error codes
- Comprehensive validation at all levels
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Graceful failure handling

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end scenario testing
- **Edge Case Testing**: Invalid routes, missing seats, etc.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major code paths tested

## Assumptions & Tradeoffs

### Key Assumptions

**1. Single-Leg Journeys**

- **Assumption**: All bookings are for single-leg journeys on one service
- **Rationale**: Assignment scenario 3 is ambiguous about multi-leg journeys
- **Tradeoff**: Simplified implementation vs. complex multi-leg logic

**2. Date-Only Matching**

- **Assumption**: Bookings are matched by date only, ignoring time
- **Rationale**: Assignment focuses on date-based scenarios
- **Tradeoff**: Simpler logic vs. time-precise matching

**3. UTC Timezone**

- **Assumption**: All dates/times are in UTC
- **Rationale**: Simplifies implementation for assignment scope
- **Tradeoff**: Simplicity vs. international timezone support

**4. In-Memory Storage**

- **Assumption**: Data persistence is not required
- **Rationale**: Assignment focuses on business logic, not persistence
- **Tradeoff**: Fast development vs. production scalability

### Design Tradeoffs

**1. Simplicity vs. Flexibility**

- **Chosen**: Simple, focused implementation
- **Benefit**: Easier to understand, test, and maintain
- **Sacrifice**: Multi-leg journeys, complex routing

**2. Performance vs. Features**

- **Chosen**: O(n) linear search for seat availability
- **Benefit**: Simple implementation, adequate for assignment scale
- **Sacrifice**: Indexed lookups, caching, optimization

**3. Data Integrity vs. Complexity**

- **Chosen**: Basic validation and error handling
- **Benefit**: Reliable core functionality
- **Sacrifice**: Advanced business rules, complex constraints

## Code Quality & Best Practices

### Go Best Practices

- **Package Structure**: Clear package organization
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent Go naming patterns
- **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation and handling
- **Documentation**: Clear function and type documentation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage

### Software Engineering Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.
- **DRY**: Don't repeat yourself
- **KISS**: Keep it simple, stupid
- **YAGNI**: You aren't gonna need it
